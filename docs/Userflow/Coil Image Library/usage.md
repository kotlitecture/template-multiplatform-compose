# Usage

## Overview

The usage guide is best described in the official component [documentation](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/).

The inclusion of this component adds the dependency on this component and provides some general examples of how it can be used.

In addition, it also extends the behaviour of the design component `AppIcon` with an extra model. See the example below.

## Example

```kotlin
AppIcon(
    model = UrlModel("https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300")
)
```
