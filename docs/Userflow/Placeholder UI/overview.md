# About

Commonly seen in applications, placeholders fill the fields and items with temporary content, often exhibiting a blinking or shimmering behavior. This approach enhances the user experience by providing a sense of progress and a preview of the layout, making the wait for actual content feel shorter and more engaging. Placeholders are essential in creating smooth and responsive interfaces, ensuring that users are informed and visually engaged while the real data is being fetched.
 This component provides a composable modifier for displaying a 'placeholder' UI while content is loading.
