     * Determines if the cached data associated with this key is considered immortal.
     * In terms of the API, immortality means that the cache entry initialization request
     * is not bound to the lifecycle of the component from which it is called.
     *
     * For example, if a cache entry initialization request is called from a View (Fragment/Activity),
     * it will be canceled once the view is destroyed.
     * When a key is immortal, the cache entry will be initialized regardless of the component lifecycle.
     *
     * This can be useful when you need to proceed with some request without interruptions.

     * Another example:
     *
     * an OAuth refresh token actualization response needs to be completed and stored locally
     * as an atomic action, so any further calls under OAuth authorization can continue with the newly obtained token.
     * If such an action is processed on the server but interrupted and not stored on the client,
     * it is possible that the old token becomes outdated and any further request to update it will fail.
     *
     * The immortal key helps reduce such issues by ensuring that cache entries are initialized
     * even if the associated component lifecycle ends.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the data associated with this key is immortal, {@code false} otherwise.
